            <h2>We Are Here To Help</h2>
            <p>
              Death is a necessary part of life but it can arrive unexpectedly. Even when a death is anticipated, many of us are too impacted by grief to effectively accompish the tasks needed by law or custom to arrange for a burial or even notify the correct authorities. LastFavors was developed to help guide people through the proper steps following a death. Afterall, millions experience loss each year, but for someone thrust into the position of quickly planning a funeral, these steps are brand new.  <img src="img/newHands3.png" width=320px height=214px style="float:left" alt="A man's hand gently holds the hand of an elderly woman" title="A man's hand gently holds the hand of an elderly woman" />

            <p>
              Many people are unprepared for when their aging parents die. Nowadays, family members often do not live in the same city -- or even state -- as each other. Regardless of the distance from a loved one, funerals often take place within a week of death, much sooner in some religious traditions. But what is the first thing the survivor of an unexpected death should do? Who do they contact? Did they find out what sort of arrangements the deceased wanted? Who they wanted to invite to their funeral? Would you even know how to find your grandmother's second-grade classmate to invite her? These are just a sample of the barrage of questions that need to be answered in a time of grief and distraction.

              </ul>          
              Additionally, the following information should be available:

              "I woke up next to my husband and he had passed in his sleep. I didn't know what to do; I felt lost and unprepared and alone. Fortunately, we had used the LastFavors app a couple of months before and it helped me navigate my way through that mess. Honestly, that time is a blur I've blocked out because of trauma. The only thing I remember is being able to rely on LastFavors when I didn't have the strength or wherewithal to figure out what I should do next." <span class="source"> -- Alice M., Huntsville, AL</span>
